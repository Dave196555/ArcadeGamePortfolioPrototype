# Arcade Game Portfolio Prototype

This is an arcade game I made in a few weeks to demonstrate my ability to work on a project from idea to production.
The game executable is named ArcadePrototype.exe and placed in the ArcadeGame folder.

## Controls

Currently only keyboard controls are supported.

You can use WASD to move your character, and click on the screen to shoot. You also navigate menus by clicking on text.
I may add controller support on a later date.

# Save storage

Save files for the game are simple json files located at the following directory:
`C:\Users\UserName\AppData\LocalLow\David Kellam\ArcadePrototype`
If you need to delete this file it is safe to do so, re-opening the game will make a new empty save if one is not present.
